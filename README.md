# 📚 Learn Pandas with Practice

This repository contains my **step-by-step Pandas learning journey**.  
Each day I studied one topic, wrote detailed notes with explanations & code, and solved practice exercises.  
The goal is to build a strong foundation in Pandas for data analysis & machine learning.

👉 Question for you: Do you want your README to feel more like a **personal study journal** (focused on your growth) or a **public tutorial** (as if teaching others Pandas)? The tone will change depending on that.
